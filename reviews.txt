revew:   I have no complains regarding the Delivery from Amazon. It was quick and product was well packed.
However, regarding the product itself, its a FreeDOS laptop. People need to consider it while buying it. Installing Drivers from the HP support is really a pain and takes a lot of patience. For example, the Drivers for WLAN & Bluetooth provided on site are for Realtek, however my Laptop was dispatched with a Broadcom Chip, a fact only known when the Support guy verified it by serial number. Similarly, problems with USB Host controller, PCI SMbus, Webcam (because the chipset driver also didnt match the one available on site).
The HP Support guys were helpful and searched for drivers and gave me links to download, but this entire process took a good 4-5 hours and led to a lot of frustration. but one thing to note is, if you install a pirated or a non activated version of any Windows OS, the Support guys may refuse to help you as they cant do so officially.
However, I wish to affirm that, once these problems are sorted out, the Product is working as expected. no complains so far. So if you are buying be ready to invest a substantial amount of your time to get this up and running.

revew:   This is a Good Product in budget price.My suggestion for people trying to buy this product is that please don't even try to install Windows 7 on this Laptop it has lot of issues and even drivers provided in HP website wont help solving the issues.Instead install Windows 10,this laptop works perfectly on Windows 10.Finally suggestion to HP..Please atleast provide device drivers CD with your Laptops ..dont try for cost cutting in this basic requirement.
